  to compute QR factorization in-place,
  [`dormqr`](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/da/dba/group__double_o_t_h_e_rcomputational_ga17b0765a8a0e6547bcf933979b38f0b0.html#ga17b0765a8a0e6547bcf933979b38f0b0)
  to apply action of Q to a matrix C in-place. Compare [Julia's
  `qr`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/index.html#LinearAlgebra.qr),
  which is simultaneously a full and reduced factorization, with
  Python's, which flattens to naive representation of Q.
