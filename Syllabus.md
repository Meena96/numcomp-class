# Syllabus: COVID-19 Update

* We've gone entirely virtual and our strategy going forward will be informed by the [survey results](survey.md).
* We use [this Zoom meeting](https://cuboulder.zoom.us/j/595752781) for:
  * Live meetings at the usual lecture period time (TR 9:30-10:45).
  * Office hours as posted on the calendar.
  * As an open room that people can drop in any time to talk with peers.  Jed or a GSS will join the
    room during office hours and on request (best effort).
* Recordings of these Zoom meetings will be posted on Moodle.
* We created a Piazza.  You should have gotten an invite, or can follow a link from Moodle.  Please
  start new discussions and comment on threads there.
* Group presentations of small individual projects is postponed until after break.  You'll have a
  choice of whether to record a 5-minute video presentation or write a 1-pager+figures, then we'll
  have a couple days of open discussion within groups.
* The Participation/Activity and Homework categories will be merged.  We won't have the more
  in-depth homeworks from here on out, but will have more activities, often with open-ended
  questions toward the end.  This is largely a participation grade (don't stress if you don't get
  everything working; you can still get full credit, but please discuss what you don't understand in
  Piazza, Zoom, GitHub issues, etc.).

## Evaluation

### 20% class participation and in-class activities
Please bring a computer to class so that you can complete activities using Jupyter or Moodle.
These will be short and you'll be able to finish during class.
If you can't attend a particular class, you may still accept the activity and complete it within 48 hours of the class for full credit.

### 10% Perusall readings and discussion
We will have regular readings from various sources (online material, book excerpts, etc.) that I'll share via Perusall.
This tool allows you to ask and answer questions (anonymously or not) and rate peer answers.
Your participation will inform lecture content and class activities.

### 30% homework
There will be several homework assignments in which you will develop and evaluate numerical methods.
You will have at least one week from the date such an assignment is announced until its due date.
These assignments will usually consist of a combination of autograded and manually-graded parts (such as figures or free-text explanations); feedback will be returned within a week.

### 15% midterm exam
There will be one in-class midterm covering roughly the first half of the course, tentatively scheduled for March 5.

### 5% group presentations
You will give individual presentations to small groups about a method or application of numerical computation, applying concepts learned in class.
Each presentation will be followed by a question and answer session.
This is tentatively scheduled for March 17.

### 20% final project
The final project will involve working in teams of 3-4 on a project of your choosing.
Each team will give a presentation during the "final exam period" at the end of the semester.
Following all presentations, each team member will participate individually in a question and answer session.

## Technology

### Git and GitHub

Homework assignments and in-class activities will be submitted via Git.  This class will use GitHub classroom.

To follow along with lectures, you can fork the [class repository](https://github.com/cu-numcomp/numcomp-class).  Homeworks will be completed by cloning GitHub repositories, completing coding and analysis activities using Jupyter, and pushing completed assignments back to GitHub.

You will complete assignments using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), which is available on the [Coding CSEL Hub](https://coding.csel.io/) and can be installed locally on most operating systems.

It is notoriously difficult to predict the time required to develop quality code, so please start early to give yourself plenty of time.  You are welcome to work together on all assignments, but must give credit to collaborators (at the top of each notebook).  You should ensure that each assignment you submit contains significant intellectual contribution of your own.

### Programming languages and environment

I will use Python with [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) in class and for homeworks.  This environment is convenient to work with, general purpose, and has extensive library support.  Native Python code is not high performance, however, so the scientific Python stack depends on numerical libraries written in other languages, such as C, C++, or Fortran.  MATLAB is also popular for numerical computing, though it is a proprietary environment and lacks general-purpose libraries.  Octave is a free MATLAB clone and Julia is a modern language that preserves much of the syntactic convenience.

Most high-performance computing (HPC), data science, and cloud resources use a Linux operating system.  You can use any environment for your local development environment, but I recommend the [Coding CSEL Hub](https://coding.csel.io/) because it includes a complete software environment and you can access it from any machine.

### Moodle

Moodle will be used to maintain grades.  Please [enroll yourself](https://moodle.cs.colorado.edu).

### Perusall

Perusall is a tool for social reading.
We'll use it to preview material before class and as formative assessment with concepts we cover in class.
It's meant to encourage collaboration and written communication about concepts.
There will be a small participation grade associated with these activities.
If you read the document and participate by asking and/or answering questions, you'll receive full credit.
Skimming at the last-minute will result in partial credit.
